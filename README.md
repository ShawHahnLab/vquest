# Automate IMGT V-QUEST usage on imgt.org

**Work In Progress**

[IMGT](http://imgt.org)'s V-QUEST is only available via a web interface.  This
Python module tries to automate V-QUEST usage by submitting request data like
the web form does.  This is a draft that'll have to wait for more development
until imgt.org comes back online.

 * V-QUEST docs: <http://www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/user_guide#intro>
 * A different approach, using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to automate V-QUEST usage with a browser: <https://github.com/AndrewZoldy/IMGT_VQUEST_BOT>
